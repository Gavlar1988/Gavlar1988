- 👋 Hi, I’m Gav
- 👀 I’m interested in educating myself and wanting to learn something different - once iv learnt the basics il master the rest
- 🌱 Slowly picking all this up feel abit out of my comfort zone at the moment
- 💞️ Was a bit slow to pick up on things in life, struggled with mental health alot but learning more every day positive steps 🤓😎
- 📫 How to reach me? Too much personal information shared already
- ❤️ Will find me when its ready 
- 🫵 Open to meeting new friends, opening my friendship group to learn as much as possible,
 in the least amount of time possible I would appreciate someone who could take me under their wing and edumacate me
